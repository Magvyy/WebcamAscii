# WebcamAscii

Note: to use this project you need maven installed.
 
This project of mine uses Sarxos' webcam capture library found at https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture to capture an image from the default webcam device on any given system, and print out an ASCII representation of the image. It does this through going pixel by pixel and converts the pixel to grayscale, then uses the value of the pixel to index into an array of ASCII characters in increasing order of brightness (or size). If the image is too large (has too many pixels) such that its ASCII representation can't properly fit in a terminal, you can pass an integer value (referred to as scale), that'll partition the image into blocks of pixels. The program will then, instead of converting each pixel into an ASCII character, find the average grayscale pixel value of each block and convert that into an ASCII character. You can also use the methods from each class, if you so wish, to get the ASCII representation of any image, as the webcam is only used in the main method, but do note that in WebCamASciiFlip, the getAsciiFromImage method flips the image. If you wish to use either class, navigate to the project folder in a terminal, and use the following commands for their respective classes: mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="MyWebAscii.WebCamAscii" or mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="MyWebAscii.WebCamAsciiFlip".

This project is free to use for anyone, though I would like it if you referenced me in the use.
